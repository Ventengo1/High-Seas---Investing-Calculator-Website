      <h2>What is Investing?</h2>
      <p>Investing is the process of allocating money to assets with the expectation of generating a return. It's like planting a seed and watching it grow over time.</p>

      <h2>Savings Account vs. Investment Account Comparison</h2>
      <p>A Savings Account is a type of deposit account at a bank that typically offers a low but stable interest rate. Your money grows slowly, primarily from the fixed interest earned, and there's little risk involved.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, an Investment Account (like one invested in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds) has the potential to earn much higher returns. However, it also comes with a risk of losing value in the short term, as investment returns are not guaranteed and depend on market performance.</p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>If you start with an initial amount of $1,000 and contribute $100 monthly over 10 years:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Savings Account:</strong> At an average 1% annual interest rate, your account could grow to around $13,000, thanks to compounded interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Investment Account:</strong> At an average 7% annual return rate, your account could potentially grow to over $18,000. However, remember that investments can fluctuate and may not provide a steady rate of return.</li>
      </ul>
